These are a few one liners for the Bash command line to verify the results of the BST and hash set analysis. 
Please note that these commands are not at all efficient. They were not written with efficiency in mind, but just
to verify the results of the BST and hash set.

Counting unique words:
- sort < holy_grail_words.lst | uniq | wc -l 

Counting word lenghts:
- for word in $(cat holy_grail_words.lst); do echo $(echo -n $word | wc -c); done | sort -n | uniq -c

Printing the ten most frequently used words with a length larger than 4. 
- awk 'length($0) > 4' < holy_grail_words.lst | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10

(To verify the results for eng_news instead, change every instance of 'holy_grail_words.lst' to 'eng_news_100K-sentences_words.lst'.
Please be aware that running these commands on this file might take a while to complete due to the inefficiency of these commands.)
